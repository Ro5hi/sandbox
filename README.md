## SubTrack
SubTrack is an SPA (Single Page Application) that allows the user to keep of track their subscriptions! The User aka Subscriber can add their monthly subscription, label it, add the subscription date, and the subscription URL to be able to easily access their account from there.

## Built with:
Structured using HTML, CSS, Javascript on the front-end and Rails in the back-end. PostgreSQL is used as the database.

## Installation:
``` Fork the file and run bundle install. Then run on local host with "rails s". ```

## Requirements:
You will need to install the required gems after forking the project to be able to run this onto your computer.

## Usage:
Users can enter their name and email address that they use for subscription accounts. After submitting, the email will be available in the drop down menu where they can enter their subscription information. Subscriptions will be listed out and can be deleted if no longer subscribed to. Users can also toggle between dark-mode or light-mode for easier viewing.

## Future plans:

- Deploy to Heroku.
- CSS Animations.
- Pie chart showing what category user is subscribed to the most.

## Credits:

I would like to thank my study group-mates(BJ, Ben, & Sam), my instructor(Morgan), and friends (Logan & Nick) for guiding me in the right direction with this project!

# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)
#   Subscription.create(id: 1, category: "Membership", name: "Amazon", link: "https://amazon.com", recurring_date: "Every 5th", price: 10, subscriber_id: 1, email: "test@email.com")
#   Subscriber.create(id: 1, name: "Test", email: "test@email.com")
